            It’s hard to document memories but scrapbooking is a fun way to keep those memories safe forever. For a crafter,  scrapbooking is one of the best ways to get your creative juices flowing. There is no way to get bored with this line of craft because the possibilities of what one can do are endless--it just depends on how far your imagination can go. 

            As a beginner, everyone struggles with where to start because there is just so much to do. This is why I have come up with this blog post as a way to make it easier for you to navigate through the process. </p><p>
            <ol>
            <li>Choosing a theme
              <p>
            If you constantly browse through scrapbooking ideas like me, you will know that people create scrapbooks that give out different vibes. These themes are the core essence of a scrapbook as they decide what vibe it gives out. For instance, you can give a vintage look to the scrapbook by choosing craft cardstock as your base.

            Finding inspiration
<p>
            Inspiration can come from a lot of places. For me, the best way to be inspired is by looking at general layouts and wondering what I can do to make them look more personal or  trying to find the best way to use the scraps I have lying around. The best place to begin finding inspiration is Pinterest. It has a lot of pins that helped me to find what worked best for me.

            Planning ahead 
<p>
            Even as a panster, I recognize that planning beforehand is the way to go. Not only does it save you time, it saves you energy as well. Some of the things that one should plan beforehand are the size of the scrapbook and layouts you intend to make.

            Adding a personal touch 
<p>
            Scrapbooks are a fun way to hold your memories together and they make for a wonderful gift. Adding handwritten notes, doodling in the margins adds both an aesthetic and homey touch.

            If you feel lost…<br/>

            Some of my favorite and simple things to add in a scrapbook are waterfall cards, shaker cards, and twisted cards. The best part about them? They look cute everywhere. Seriously, these are a lifesaver. I  truly believe you can never go wrong with these. 

            And that’s it, folks. Zi personally believe this is all you need to craft a scrapbook (aside from the supplies, of course
