            Light has always peaked my curiosity. Everyone craves it, but when they find it they turn away. They like buying new candles, with various fragrances, shapes and colours. They look so pretty, so beautiful - like the flowers where the fragrances come from. But  they burn too; they burn you so easily. One wrong angle and you have that wax falling on your fingers, your hand. But people love them anyway. Is this why people like the ones who can burn them? Then, who's to say they won't like the ones that burn the world. </p><p>

I like my candles pretty and colourful, but more than that I like them as decorative. They just become the focus of a decor. Hailing from a country where an entire festival is celebrated about light defeating dark, I've always been around enough candles all my life. I've liked lighting them, making them or even gifting them.</p><p>

Today, I'm going to teach you the art of making a candle holder for gifting them to your loved ones and making their life a little bit brighter.These candles are going to be made with the quilling technique. <br/> So, here is a list of materials that you'll need.<br/>
<ul>

<li>Cardboard for Base</li>
<li>Quilling Strips in varied colours (You can even make these by cutting strips from papers of your choice)</li>
<li>Quilling tool (You can use your hand, but it's just so much easier with this!)</li>
<li>Glue</li>
<li>Some decorative items (Optional)</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
  Let's Start <br/>
<ol>
<li>Start with a basic design in your head, of how you want your candle holder to look. If you want inspiration, you can look at some of mine <a href="candles.html">here</a>.</li>

<li>To make leaves and petals, or any other items, just roll the strips tightly. You can loosen them if you want to in the end, but its easier to just let it be a tight roll now.</li>

<li>Use your fingers to give desired shape and continue making them however long you need. (It's better if you use multiple colours to make it look prettier effortlessly)</li>

<li>Cut out a circle with a radius of atleast 1 cm more than the radius of your candle and Mark your candle space.</li>

<li>Now stick the items to your base and viola! your candle holder is good to go.(Optionally you may want to make an inner circle for your candle, to make it more attractive.)</li>
</ol>

Now you can gift these candles to your loved ones :) and bring joy to their lives, one candle at a time.

If you would like to buy any from my collection, message me <a href="index.html#contact">here</a>.

Thanks and have a great day!</p>
